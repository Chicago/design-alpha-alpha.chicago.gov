We want everyone who visits chicago.gov to feel welcome and find the experience rewarding.

## What are we doing?

To help us make chicago.gov a positive place for everyone, we've been using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities, and user friendly for everyone.

The guidelines have three levels of accessibility (A, AA and AAA). Weâ€™ve chosen Level AA as the target for the _Resilient Chicago_ website.

## How are we doing?

We've worked hard on chicago.gov and believe we've achieved our goal of Level AA accessibility. We monitor the website regularly to maintain this, but if you do find any problems, please get in touch.

## Let us know what you think

If you enjoyed using chicago.gov, or if you had trouble with any part of it, please get in touch. We'd like to hear from you in any of the following ways:
