_A markup experiment in converting cityofchicago.org content to Chicago Design System._

This project is no longer maintained.
It was an early attempt to implement Chicago Design System code to address common City of Chicago web UI patterns.
This work is now continued in other [design team repositories](https://github.com/orgs/Chicago/teams/design/repositories).
